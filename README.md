# qmarxanz
QMarxanZ for QGIS 2.x is a complete rewrite of QMarxan for QGIS 1.x

QMarxanZ provides support for vector and raster calculations as well as using raster estimtation (like zonal statistics) for complex vector data sources to speed processing times.

QMarxanZ stores all calculations in sparse csv files to speed creation of Marxan input files and allow for more than 255 features.

Version 0.5 does not support Maraxn with Zones, but the fundamental architecture does provide this support and future releases will have a Marxan with Zones project type.
